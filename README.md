Ludum Dare 31 - Dec 2014

Make a game in 48 hours with theme 'Entire Game On One Screen'.

There is a Snowman because when I tried to create graphics, the only thing that I mangaged to do is... a Snowman!

This is a Point 'n' Click game using Unity3D Game Engine and C# Scripting.

This is an aborted game... :(
